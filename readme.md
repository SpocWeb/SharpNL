#SharpNL

## What is this?

> An awesome and independent reimplementation of the [Apache OpenNLP] software library in C#

## Release

> Public release available at [NuGet] \(Current version: 1.0 __Beta__\)

## Main features/characteristics

> - Fully C# managed NET 4.5 library
> - Fully compatible with the OpenNLP models.
> - Was built from scratch by hand, without any assist tool in order to maximize the synergy with .net technology.
> - There are [analyzers](https://github.com/knuppe/SharpNL/wiki/Analyzers) that help a lot the implementation and abstraction of this library.  
> - The heavy operations (like training) can be monitored and cancelled.
> - Some file formats were revamped/improved (Ad and Penn Treebank).
> - The deprecated methods from OpenNLP were not ported!
> - English inflection tools.
> - WordNet 3.0 integration.

## Goals

> Implement the best library of natural language processing in C#, which means:
> - Be as lightweight as possible
> - Have a good set of tools available in a single library

## TODO

> - Run a Profiler to reduce memory and CPU utilization.
> - Ensure that the library is compatible with Mono.

## Support

As a human being I like to be honest, I believe that someday our kind will transcend money... 
But unfortunately, while we have not reached this day I need some money to make my living. 
If you like this project or need to use this library in the future please consider making a 
donation (anything helps), writing this library takes a HUGE amount of my time, effort and 
resources. But I do it because I'm passionate about it, and hope to make an impact on the 
world while also sharing my little knowledge as a human being.

Please, consider donating as a thank you.
